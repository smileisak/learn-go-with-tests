# Notes

## Remarks

1. Property Based Testing

Once we're more familiar with Go's syntax I will introduce a technique called "Property Based Testing", 
which would stop annoying developers and help you find bugs.

1. A method is a function with a receiver. A method declaration binds an identifier, the method name, to a method, and associates the method with the receiver's base type.

1. These pointers to structs even have their own name: struct pointers and they are automatically dereferenced.
